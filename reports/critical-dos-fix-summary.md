# Critical DoS Vulnerability Fix - Slippage Cap Removal

**Date**: 2025-08-27  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

## Vulnerability Discovery

During security review, we identified that the 5% hardcoded maximum slippage cap could cause a **complete denial of service** for withdrawals during vault distress scenarios.

## The Critical Problem

### Scenario: Vault Depeg DoS
1. MetaMorpho vault depegs by 10% due to bad debt
2. User attempts withdrawal
3. Actual value: 90% of expected
4. Slippage check: 90% < 95% minimum (5% max slippage)
5. **Result**: Transaction reverts with `SlippageExceeded`
6. **Impact**: Users permanently trapped in failing vault

### Why This Is Critical
- Users cannot exit during the exact scenarios where exit is most crucial
- No emergency bypass mechanism existed
- Could result in total loss if vault fails completely
- Affects ALL users of the vault simultaneously

## The Solution

**Approach**: Remove hardcoded maximum, allow governance to set up to 100%

### Implementation (Commit: `a60e36f`)
```diff
- uint256 private constant MAX_ALLOWED_SLIPPAGE_BPS = 50000; // 5% cap
  
  function setMaxSlippage(uint256 newSlippageBps) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
-     if (newSlippageBps > MAX_ALLOWED_SLIPPAGE_BPS) {
-         revert SlippageTooHigh(newSlippageBps, MAX_ALLOWED_SLIPPAGE_BPS);
+     if (newSlippageBps > BasisPointConstants.ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_BPS) {
+         revert SlippageTooHigh(newSlippageBps, BasisPointConstants.ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT_BPS);
      }
```

### Benefits
1. **Emergency Response**: Governance can increase tolerance during crises
2. **User Protection**: Users can always exit, even at a loss
3. **Flexibility**: Adapts to market conditions without code changes
4. **Simplicity**: Clean solution without complex emergency logic

## Risk Analysis

### Before Fix
- **Risk**: Total fund lock during >5% depeg
- **User Options**: None - completely trapped
- **Recovery**: Requires code upgrade

### After Fix  
- **Risk**: Managed through governance
- **User Options**: Can exit at market value
- **Recovery**: Governance can adjust immediately

## Governance Playbook

### Normal Operations
- Keep slippage at 1-2% for MEV protection

### Market Stress (5-10% volatility)
- Temporarily increase to 10-15%
- Monitor and adjust as needed

### Emergency (>10% depeg)
- Immediately increase to 50-100%
- Allow users to exit at market rates
- Reduce after crisis passes

## Testing Confirmation

✅ Governance can set slippage from 0-100%  
✅ Cannot exceed 100% (prevents nonsensical values)  
✅ Existing functionality preserved  
✅ All tests passing

## Lessons Learned

1. **Protection mechanisms can become traps** - Slippage protection meant to help users ended up potentially trapping them
2. **Always provide emergency exits** - Users must be able to exit, even at unfavorable rates
3. **Governance flexibility is crucial** - Hardcoded limits prevent emergency response
4. **Test extreme scenarios** - This vulnerability only appears during crisis conditions

## Recommendation

This fix is **CRITICAL** and must be included before any deployment, including testnet. Without it, a single vault failure could trap all user funds permanently.

**Status**: Ready for deployment with this critical fix applied.
