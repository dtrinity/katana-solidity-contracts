## [CROSS-MODULE-CRITICAL-01] Oracle Manipulation → dSTAKE → dETH Liquidation Cascade
**Modules Affected**: Oracle → dSTAKE → dETH → dLend
**Attack Vector**: Oracle price manipulation triggering cascading liquidations

**Description**:
An attacker manipulates oracle prices for underlying assets (e.g., ETH, stETH) that back dSTAKE vault assets. The DStakeCollateralVault.totalValueInDStable() function relies entirely on adapter price feeds via `IDStableConversionAdapter.assetValueInDStable()`, which in turn depends on external oracle prices. When dSTAKE is used as collateral in the dETH system, oracle manipulation can trigger liquidations that cascade across modules.

**Impact**:
- Immediate devaluation of dSTAKE collateral triggers dETH position liquidations
- Liquidations create selling pressure on dSTAKE, further depressing prices
- Cross-module contagion spreads to dLend positions using dETH as collateral
- Attacker can profit from liquidation penalties (typically 5-15% of position value)

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Attack Cost**: $500K-2M to manipulate prices on low-liquidity oracle feeds
- **Profit Potential**: $5-20M from liquidation penalties and arbitrage
- **Risk/Reward**: 10:1 to 40:1 ratio makes attack highly profitable

**PoC**:
1. Attacker identifies dSTAKE positions backing significant dETH collateral
2. Flash loan attack on oracle price feed (e.g., Chainlink manipulation via market orders)
3. dSTAKE value drops 20%+ due to oracle price update
4. Automated liquidations trigger across dETH positions
5. Attacker captures liquidation penalties and arbitrage profits

**Mitigation**:
- Implement price change rate limits (max 10%/hour)
- Use multiple independent oracle sources with median pricing
- Add time-weighted average pricing (TWAP) with minimum 30-minute windows
- Implement circuit breakers for large price movements

## [CROSS-MODULE-HIGH-02] dLend Interest Rate Feedback Loop via dSTAKE
**Modules Affected**: dSTAKE → dLend → Oracle → dSTAKE
**Attack Vector**: Manipulation of dLend utilization rates through dSTAKE deposits/withdrawals

**Description**:
The WrappedDLendConversionAdapter creates a circular dependency where dSTAKE vault performance affects dLend pool utilization, which affects interest rates, which affects dSTAKE vault yield, creating exploitable feedback loops. Large dSTAKE deposits/withdrawals can dramatically shift dLend pool dynamics.

**Impact**:
- Interest rate manipulation affects all dLend users
- dSTAKE yield becomes unpredictable and exploitable
- JIT (Just-In-Time) attacks on vault deposits before favorable rate changes
- Unfair value extraction from other vault participants

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Attack Capital Required**: $1-5M to meaningfully impact pool rates
- **Profit Mechanism**: Yield farming arbitrage + timing attacks
- **Expected Return**: 10-50% APR through rate manipulation

**PoC**:
1. Monitor dLend pool utilization near rate cliff (e.g., 80% utilization)
2. Large dSTAKE withdrawal to push utilization over cliff (rates spike)
3. Immediately deposit at high rates, withdraw others' funds
4. Deposit back into dSTAKE at elevated rates
5. Repeat cycle to extract maximum yield

**Mitigation**:
- Implement deposit/withdrawal time delays (24-48 hours)
- Add graduated rate curves instead of sharp cliffs
- Monitor and limit single-user impact on pool utilization
- Implement dynamic fee structures based on pool impact

## [CROSS-MODULE-HIGH-03] Morpho Vault Selection Gaming
**Modules Affected**: dSTAKE → Morpho → External Markets
**Attack Vector**: Manipulation of DStakeRouterMorpho vault selection algorithm

**Description**:
The DStakeRouterMorpho uses DeterministicVaultSelector for allocation decisions, but the algorithm can be gamed by attackers who understand the selection criteria. The maxVaultsPerOperation=1 default creates predictable routing that can be front-run.

**Impact**:
- Predictable vault selection enables MEV extraction
- Sandwich attacks on large deposits/withdrawals
- Unfair distribution of yield opportunities
- Gaming of allocation rebalancing

**Economic Analysis**:
- **MEV Opportunity**: $10K-100K per large transaction
- **Attack Frequency**: Multiple times per day during high activity
- **Annual Profit Potential**: $1-10M for sophisticated MEV bots

**PoC**:
1. Monitor mempool for large dSTAKE deposits
2. Predict target vault using DeterministicVaultSelector logic
3. Front-run with deposits to target vault (capture better rates)
4. Back-run with withdrawal after victim's deposit
5. Profit from rate arbitrage

**Mitigation**:
- Randomize vault selection within allocation bands
- Increase maxVaultsPerOperation to distribute MEV impact
- Implement commit-reveal schemes for large operations
- Add randomized delays to prevent predictable timing

## [CROSS-MODULE-HIGH-04] Admin Key Compromise Cascade
**Modules Affected**: All modules via shared admin roles
**Attack Vector**: Single point of failure in admin key management

**Description**:
Multiple contracts share admin roles or have interdependent admin functions. Compromise of a single admin key can cascade across modules:
- DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE in DStakeToken can change router/vault addresses
- ADAPTER_MANAGER_ROLE can redirect all deposits to malicious adapters
- ORACLE_MANAGER_ROLE can manipulate all price feeds

**Impact**:
- Complete system compromise through admin privilege escalation
- Redirection of all user funds to attacker-controlled contracts
- Manipulation of core system parameters (fees, oracles, addresses)
- Permanent loss of user funds across all modules

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Potential Loss**: Entire TVL across all modules ($50-500M+)
- **Attack Probability**: Medium (targeted phishing, key compromise)
- **Impact**: Complete system failure

**PoC**:
1. Attacker compromises DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE key
2. Deploy malicious adapter contracts
3. Use addAdapter() to redirect future deposits
4. Use setRouter() to redirect existing vault operations
5. Extract all accessible funds through malicious contracts

**Mitigation**:
- Implement multi-signature admin controls (3/5 minimum)
- Use timelock controllers for critical parameter changes
- Separate admin roles by function with least privilege principles
- Implement emergency pause mechanisms with independent keys

## [CROSS-MODULE-MEDIUM-05] Withdrawal Fee Avoidance via Cross-Module Routing
**Modules Affected**: dSTAKE → dLend → External DEXs
**Attack Vector**: Bypassing withdrawal fees through indirect routing

**Description**:
dSTAKE implements withdrawal fees (up to 1%), but users can potentially avoid these fees by routing through other modules. For example, using dSTAKE as collateral to borrow in dLend, then selling borrowed assets.

**Impact**:
- Loss of fee revenue for the protocol
- Unfair advantage for sophisticated users
- Potential drain on protocol reserves if fees fund security measures

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Fee Avoidance**: Up to 1% per withdrawal (potentially $1M+ annually)
- **Gas Costs**: Additional routing costs may exceed fee savings for small amounts
- **Net Impact**: Moderate revenue loss, system stability impact

**PoC**:
1. User wants to withdraw $1M dSTAKE (10K fee)
2. Instead, user deposits dSTAKE as dLend collateral
3. Borrows equivalent value in other assets (2-5K borrowing costs)
4. Sells borrowed assets for desired tokens
5. Net savings: 5-8K compared to direct withdrawal

**Mitigation**:
- Implement consistent fee structures across modules
- Add fee coordination mechanisms between protocols
- Monitor for fee avoidance patterns and adjust parameters
- Consider exit fees on collateral redemption

## [CROSS-MODULE-MEDIUM-06] Dust Tolerance Exploitation in Router Exchanges
**Modules Affected**: dSTAKE Router → All connected vaults
**Attack Vector**: Exploitation of dustTolerance parameter in asset exchanges

**Description**:
The DStakeRouter uses a configurable dustTolerance (default 1 wei) for value parity checks in exchangeAssetsUsingAdapters(). This creates opportunities for value extraction through rounding manipulation and dust accumulation attacks.

**Impact**:
- Slow drain of vault value through dust accumulation
- Rounding manipulation in high-frequency trading
- Unfair value extraction from passive users

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Per-transaction profit**: 1-1000 wei (minimal individually)
- **Scaled attack**: $10K-100K annually through high-frequency dust attacks
- **Risk**: Low detection probability due to small individual amounts

**PoC**:
1. Monitor for exchange opportunities with different adapter fee structures
2. Execute many small exchanges designed to maximize rounding in attacker's favor
3. Accumulate dust over time through systematic rounding exploitation
4. Scale attack through automated high-frequency trading

**Mitigation**:
- Regular review and adjustment of dustTolerance parameters
- Implement maximum dust accumulation limits
- Monitor for systematic rounding exploitation patterns
- Consider donation of dust to protocol treasury

## [CROSS-MODULE-MEDIUM-07] MetaMorpho Vault Pause State Exploitation
**Modules Affected**: dSTAKE → Morpho → External yield sources
**Attack Vector**: Timing attacks around Morpho vault pause states

**Description**:
DStakeRouterMorpho handles paused vaults by skipping them in allocation logic, but this creates timing attack opportunities. Attackers can monitor pause states and execute large deposits/withdrawals when vault options are limited.

**Impact**:
- Reduced diversification during vault pauses increases risk
- Timing attacks on allocation decisions
- Potential forced allocation to suboptimal vaults

**Economic Analysis**:
- **Attack timing**: During Morpho vault maintenance/upgrades
- **Profit opportunity**: 5-20% yield differential during limited options
- **Frequency**: Monthly during protocol upgrades

**PoC**:
1. Monitor Morpho vault pause events
2. Execute large dSTAKE deposits when only low-yield vaults are active
3. Withdraw immediately when high-yield vaults become active again
4. Exploit allocation rebalancing for yield arbitrage

**Mitigation**:
- Implement minimum operation delays during reduced vault availability
- Add allocation buffers to handle vault pause scenarios
- Queue operations during pause periods rather than executing immediately
- Diversify across multiple yield protocols to reduce single-protocol dependency

## Conclusion

The dSTAKE system represents a sophisticated yield optimization protocol, but its tight integration with multiple DeFi modules creates significant cross-module attack surfaces. The most critical risks stem from oracle dependencies and admin key concentration, which could result in catastrophic losses. Immediate implementation of the recommended security measures is essential to protect user funds and maintain system stability.

The interconnected nature of modern DeFi protocols requires security analysis that extends beyond individual contract boundaries. This analysis demonstrates the importance of considering system-wide attack vectors and implementing coordinated defense mechanisms across all integrated modules.
