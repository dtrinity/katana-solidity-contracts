# Third Round Security Audit - Systemic Risk Analysis

## Objective
Focus on systemic risks and scenarios where protective mechanisms become vulnerabilities, inspired by the slippage DoS finding.

## Status: COMPLETED

## New Risk Categories to Examine

### 1. Protection Mechanisms as Traps
- Pause mechanisms preventing emergency exits
- Minimum thresholds blocking legitimate operations
- Rate limits during crisis scenarios
- Access controls preventing recovery

### 2. Cascading Failures
- One vault failure affecting others
- Router failures impacting all users
- Reward system failures blocking withdrawals
- Cross-component dependencies

### 3. Liquidity Crises
- Bank run scenarios
- Simultaneous mass withdrawals
- Vault liquidity exhaustion
- MEV during panic events

### 4. Governance Attack Vectors
- Parameter manipulation sequences
- Timing attacks on governance changes
- Recovery mechanism abuse
- Emergency power exploitation

### 5. Recovery & Post-Crisis
- State after emergency unpause
- Rebalancing after vault removal
- Reward distribution after outages
- User compensation mechanisms

## Key Questions
- What happens when protective mechanisms work against users?
- How do components fail together?
- What are the second-order effects of our fixes?
- Can recovery mechanisms be exploited?
