# Test Suite Fixes - Post API3 Removal

## Overview
Fix test suite issues after API3 removal and dS → dETH migration. Tests are failing due to missing fixtures and broken imports.

## Status: SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE

## Tasks Completed
- ✅ Created ticket to track progress
- ✅ Fixed missing oracle aggregator fixtures file (./fixtures import error)
- ✅ Created proper fixtures.ts with correct deployment lookups
- ✅ Added clear error messages for missing oracle wrapper deployments
- ✅ Tested multiple test suites to identify working vs failing tests
- ✅ Documented which tests work independently vs need full deployment

## Current Issues Identified
- [x] `test/oracle_aggregator/RedstoneChainlinkCompositeWrapperWithThresholding.ts` imports missing './fixtures' - FIXED
- [x] Need to review all oracle aggregator tests for API3 dependencies - 3 tests use fixtures, 1 is standalone
- [x] Check for other test files importing removed files - Oracle aggregator only
- [ ] Oracle aggregator integration tests require full system deployment (complex)
- [ ] Update test fixtures for dS → dETH migration
- [ ] Update test fixtures for Sonic → Ethereum network changes
- [ ] Ensure localhost deployment scripts work with new setup

## Priority Order
1. Fix import errors so tests can at least start
2. Fix deployment/setup issues  
3. Fix individual test failures
4. Ensure `make test` completes without errors

## Test Files Status
### Oracle Aggregator Tests
- [x] ChainlinkCompositeAggregator.ts - Works fine, no dependencies
- [ ] RedstoneChainlinkCompositeWrapperWithThresholding.ts - Needs full deployment
- [ ] RedstoneChainlinkWrapper.ts - Needs full deployment  
- [ ] RedstoneChainlinkWrapperWithThresholding.ts - Needs full deployment

### Other Test Suites
- [x] common/ tests - Working fine (Compare, SwappableVault, WithdrawalFee)
- [x] mock/ tests - Working fine (SimpleDEXMock)
- [x] odos/ tests - Working fine (BaseOdosBuyAdapter)
- [x] reward_claimable/ tests - Working fine (RewardClaimable)
- [ ] dStable tests - Failing during deployment fixture setup
- [ ] dLend tests - TBD  
- [ ] dStake tests - TBD
- [ ] dLoop tests - Some tests pending, others might need deployment
- [ ] dPool tests - TBD

## Summary

**MAIN ISSUE RESOLVED**: The primary import error (`Cannot find module './fixtures'`) has been fixed by recreating the missing fixtures file.

**CURRENT STATE**: 
- ✅ Import errors fixed - no more "Cannot find module" errors
- ✅ Several test suites working fine: common/, mock/, odos/, reward_claimable/
- ⚠️ Oracle aggregator integration tests need deployed contracts to run
- ⚠️ Some dStable/ecosystem tests failing during deployment setup

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. **For immediate `make test` fixes**: Oracle integration tests need oracle wrappers deployed first
2. **For CI/development**: Unit tests and standalone tests work fine  
3. **For integration testing**: Run deployment scripts before running integration tests

## Remaining Work (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Fix deployment fixture issues in dStable ecosystem tests
- [ ] Investigate dLend/dStake test requirements  
- [ ] Consider separate test commands for unit vs integration tests
