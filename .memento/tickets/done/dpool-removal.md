## Objective
Complete removal of all dPOOL-related code from the codebase since this product won't be launched.

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Tasks

- [x] Remove contract files  
- [x] Remove test files
- [x] Remove deployment scripts
- [x] Clean up configuration files
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] Clean up dependencies
- [x] Verify no references remain
- [x] Run compile and test validation

## Files and Directories Removed
- `/test/dpool/` - Entire test directory including:
  - `fixture.ts`
  - `Curve-integration.ts` 
  - `DPoolVaultLP.Event.test.ts`
  - `ZeroShareVulnerability.ts`
- `/deploy/11_dpool/` - Entire deployment directory including:
  - `01_deploy_vaults_and_peripheries.ts`
  - `02_configure_periphery.ts`
  - `03_verify_system.ts`
- `/contracts/testing/DPoolVaultLPMock.sol` - Mock contract
- `/contracts/mocks/MockCurveStableSwapNG.sol` - Disabled mock curve contract

## Configuration Changes Made
- **config/types.ts**: 
  - Removed `dPool` property from main `Config` interface
  - Removed entire `DPoolInstanceConfig` interface and related types
- **config/networks/localhost.ts**:
  - Removed dPOOL-related comments from token addresses
  - Removed entire `dPool` configuration section
  - Cleaned up `curvePools` mock configuration (now empty object)
- **CLAUDE.md**:
  - Updated architecture overview from 5 to 4 modules
  - Removed dPool section completely

## Verification Results

### Final dPOOL Reference Check
Searched for all remaining dPOOL references in codebase:
- **Remaining references**: Only in historical ticket files and unrelated code (ThreadPool, fakeRewardPool)
- **No active dPOOL code remains**: All functional dPOOL code successfully removed

### Build and Test Validation  
- ✅ **Compilation**: `make compile` - SUCCESS (no build errors)
- ✅ **Test Suite**: `make test` - SUCCESS (all tests pass)
- ✅ **Mock Curve Deployment**: Already properly disabled in deploy-mocks/03_mock_curve_pools.ts

### Dependencies Cleaned
- **No dPOOL-specific dependencies found**: All Curve-related code was self-contained within dPOOL module
- **Configuration clean**: All dPOOL config removed from types and network configs
- **No orphaned imports**: No unused imports related to dPOOL functionality

### Status: COMPLETE ✅
All dPOOL-related code has been successfully removed from the codebase. The system compiles and all tests pass, confirming no breaking changes were introduced.
