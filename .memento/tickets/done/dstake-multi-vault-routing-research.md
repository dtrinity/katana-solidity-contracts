# Research: Multi-Vault Routing Strategy for dSTAKE with Morpho Integration

## Objective
Research and design an intelligent routing system for dSTAKE that can optimally allocate deposits across multiple Morpho Blue vaults based on various strategies (APY optimization, risk-adjusted returns, target allocations, etc.)

## Current State
- dSTAKE currently uses a simple defaultDepositStrategyShare approach
- DStakeRouter can support multiple adapters but lacks intelligent routing logic
- Each Morpho vault can have different risk/return profiles

## Research Areas

### 1. Routing Strategies
- **APY Optimization**: Route to highest yielding vaults
- **Target Allocation**: Maintain predetermined allocation percentages
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Consider Sharpe ratio or similar metrics
- **Liquidity-Weighted**: Prioritize vaults with better liquidity
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch operations and minimize transactions

### 2. Industry Best Practices
Research how these protocols handle multi-venue routing:
- **Yearn Finance**: Vault strategies and capital allocation
- **Convex Finance**: How they route across Curve pools
- **Balancer**: Smart Order Routing (SOR) 
- **1inch**: DEX aggregation algorithms
- **Instadapp**: DSA routing logic
- **Idle Finance**: Best yield strategies
- **Harvest Finance**: Auto-compounding strategies

### 3. Technical Considerations
- On-chain vs off-chain computation
- Oracle requirements for APY/TVL data
- Rebalancing mechanisms and triggers
- Slippage protection
- Emergency withdrawal routing

### 4. Morpho-Specific Factors
- Morpho Blue market parameters
- Collateral types and risk profiles
- Utilization rates and supply caps
- Reward token considerations

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Should routing decisions be made on-chain or off-chain?
2. How frequently should allocations be rebalanced?
3. What metrics should drive routing decisions?
4. How to handle deposits when preferred vaults are at capacity?
5. Should users be able to override routing logic?

## Success Criteria
- Identify 3-5 proven routing strategies from DeFi
- Understand gas costs vs optimization benefits
- Define clear metrics for routing decisions
- Propose implementation approach suitable for dSTAKE
