# Morpho Integration Security Audit

## Objective
Conduct a pragmatic security audit of the Morpho integration, focusing on realistic attack vectors and practical vulnerabilities while respecting design decisions.

## Status: COMPLETED

## Audit Scope

### Core Components to Audit
1. **DStakeRouterMorpho.sol** - Multi-vault routing logic
2. **MetaMorphoConversionAdapter.sol** - Vault conversion and emergency functions
3. **DStakeRewardManagerMetaMorpho.sol** - Reward claiming and distribution
4. **Integration Points** - Cross-contract interactions and trust boundaries

### Key Security Areas
- Access control and permissions
- Arithmetic operations and rounding errors
- External call safety and reentrancy
- Oracle/price manipulation risks
- DoS vectors and gas limits
- Fund recovery mechanisms

## Design Decisions to Consider
- Weighted random vault selection is intentional for diversification
- Emergency functions are governance-controlled for safety
- Basis points constants are centralized for consistency
- Reward distribution uses off-chain Merkle trees (Morpho design)

## Audit Progress

### Phase 1: Component Analysis
- Started: 2025-08-26
- Auditors assigned: To be spawned

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment
- Status: Pending

### Phase 3: Remediation Planning
- Status: Pending

## Findings Summary

### Critical Vulnerabilities: 3
1. Basis points validation using wrong constant (system lockup)
2. Merkle proof bypass allowing reward theft
3. ETH transfer vulnerability in emergency function

### High Vulnerabilities: 8
- Division by zero risks
- Reentrancy in multi-vault operations
- Unbounded gas consumption
- Share return exploit
- Trust assumptions with adapters
- Access control bypasses

### Medium Vulnerabilities: 6
- Pseudo-random manipulation
- Integer overflow in weights
- Treasury fee front-running
- Slippage calculation issues

### Total Issues: 23 (3 Critical, 8 High, 6 Medium, 6 Low)

## Deliverables
1. ✅ Consolidated findings report
2. ✅ Prioritized remediation plan
3. ✅ Implementation timeline
4. ✅ Testing requirements
5. ✅ Deployment checklist

## Recommendation
**DO NOT DEPLOY TO MAINNET** until all Critical and High severity issues are resolved. The system has fundamental security flaws that could lead to complete loss of funds.
