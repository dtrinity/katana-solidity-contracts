# Deterministic Vault Selection Implementation

**Status**: Next  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Feature Implementation  

## Objective

Replace the current weighted random vault selection mechanism in DStakeRouterMorpho with a deterministic top-X selection algorithm to achieve 5-10% gas savings while maintaining effective vault rebalancing.

## Background

Current implementation uses pseudo-random selection with weights based on allocation deltas. Analysis shows deterministic selection provides:
- 5-10% gas savings by removing randomness overhead
- Predictable behavior for easier testing
- Simpler codebase maintenance
- Equivalent rebalancing effectiveness

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
1. **Replace random selection with deterministic top-X selection**
   - For deposits: Select top X most underallocated vaults
   - For withdrawals: Select top X most overallocated vaults
   - Configurable selection count (default: 1, max: determined by gas limit analysis)

2. **Clean refactor of existing code**
   - Replace WeightedRandomSelector library with new DeterministicVaultSelector
   - Update DStakeRouterMorpho to use deterministic selection
   - Remove all randomness-related code (nonce, seed generation)
   - Maintain Morpho naming convention for Morpho-specific contracts

3. **Gas optimization targets**
   - Achieve 5-10% reduction in gas costs vs current implementation
   - Ensure selection count max is 50% of feasible gas limit threshold

### Technical Specifications

#### Selection Algorithm
```solidity
// Deposits: Select vaults with largest (target - current) allocations
// Withdrawals: Select vaults with largest (current - target) allocations
// Use partial sort for O(k*n) complexity where k = selection count
```

#### Configuration Parameters
- `maxVaultsPerOperation`: Default 1, max TBD based on gas analysis
- Should be updatable by VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE

#### Event Updates
- Remove `randomSeed` parameter from events or set to 0
- Maintain existing event structure for compatibility

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Contract Implementation

1. **Create DeterministicVaultSelector Library**
   - Location: `contracts/vaults/dstake/libraries/DeterministicVaultSelector.sol`
   - Functions:
     - `selectTopUnderallocated(vaults, currentBps, targetBps, count)`
     - `selectTopOverallocated(vaults, currentBps, targetBps, count)`
     - `calculateUnderallocations(currentBps, targetBps)`
     - `calculateOverallocations(currentBps, targetBps)`

2. **Update DStakeRouterMorpho**
   - Remove WeightedRandomSelector import and usage
   - Replace with DeterministicVaultSelector
   - Remove nonce state variable
   - Update deposit() and withdraw() functions
   - Set default maxVaultsPerOperation to 1
   - Calculate and set safe maximum based on gas limits

3. **Remove Obsolete Code**
   - Delete WeightedRandomSelector.sol library
   - Remove any test contracts specific to random selection
   - Clean up unused imports and variables

### Phase 2: Deploy Scripts

4. **Update Deployment Scripts**
   - Location: `deploy/vaults/dstake/`
   - Update router deployment to set maxVaultsPerOperation to 1
   - Remove any random-selection specific initialization

### Phase 3: Testing

5. **Update Existing Tests**
   - Location: `test/dstake/`
   - Update test expectations for deterministic behavior
   - Remove randomness-related test cases
   - Add deterministic selection validation

6. **Add New Test Coverage**
   - Test top-X selection accuracy
   - Test edge cases (all at target, single vault, no healthy vaults)
   - Test gas consumption vs baseline
   - Test rebalancing convergence

7. **Integration Tests**
   - Full deployment and operation flow
   - Multi-vault deposits and withdrawals
   - Allocation convergence over multiple operations

## Success Criteria

All following commands must pass without errors:

```bash
make lint      # All linting passes
make compile   # Compilation successful
make deploy    # Deployment scripts execute
make test      # All tests pass
```

### Specific Metrics
- [x] Gas reduction: 5-10% on deposit/withdraw operations
- [x] All existing dstake tests pass with updates
- [x] Deterministic selection correctly picks top-X vaults
- [x] maxVaultsPerOperation configurable with safe upper limit

## Notes for Sub-Agents

### Important Guidelines
1. **No backwards compatibility needed** - this is a clean refactor before merge
2. **Morpho naming** - Keep "Morpho" in contract names for Morpho-specific implementations
3. **Clean removal** - Delete old randomness code completely, we have git history
4. **Gas limit analysis** - Determine safe max vaults based on block gas limit (30M gas)
5. **Default to 1 vault** - Start conservative, can increase based on testing

### Testing Focus
- Ensure deterministic behavior (same inputs = same outputs)
- Validate gas savings vs previous implementation
- Test allocation convergence over time
- Edge case handling (empty vaults, all at target, etc.)

### Code Quality
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Maintain comprehensive NatSpec documentation
- Use explicit error messages for all reverts
- Optimize for gas efficiency

## Dependencies

- OpenZeppelin contracts (existing)
- BasisPointConstants (existing)
- AllocationCalculator library (existing)
