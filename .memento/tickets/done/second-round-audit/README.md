# Second Round Security Audit - Post-Fix Review

## Objective
Conduct deeper security analysis after fixing initial vulnerabilities, focusing on:
- Edge cases and corner scenarios
- Economic attacks and game theory
- Integration risks between components
- Upgrade and migration paths
- Learnings from first audit round

## Status: COMPLETED

## Audit Focus Areas

### 1. Edge Cases & State Transitions
- Empty vault scenarios
- Maximum allocation edge cases
- Precision loss in calculations
- State consistency during failures

### 2. Economic & Game Theory
- MEV opportunities
- Sandwich attacks
- Griefing attacks
- Incentive alignment

### 3. Integration Risks
- Cross-contract reentrancy
- Oracle manipulation
- Flash loan attacks
- Composability risks

### 4. Upgrade & Migration
- Storage collision risks
- Initialization gaps
- Migration path security
- Emergency procedures

## Learnings Applied
- Look beyond obvious vulnerabilities
- Consider trust boundaries carefully
- Analyze economic incentives
- Check for subtle precision issues
- Verify all assumptions
