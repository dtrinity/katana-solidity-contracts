## dSTAKE — High-Level Overview

dSTAKE is a yield-bearing stablecoin vault. Users deposit a dSTABLE asset (e.g., dUSD) and receive dSTAKE shares (`ERC4626`). Capital is routed into external lending protocols through pluggable adapters while accounting, fees, and governance live on the dSTAKE side. This document captures the current architecture and the operational handles maintainers rely on.

### Components At A Glance

- `DStakeTokenV2` – upgradeable ERC4626 share token (`contracts/vaults/dstake/DStakeTokenV2.sol`)
  - Implements the standard ERC4626 flows; solvers and fee logic now live on the router.
  - Overrides the OZ core hooks (`_deposit`, `_withdraw`) to call `router.handleDeposit` / `router.handleWithdraw` once shares and accounting are settled inside the token.
  - Reads total value and withdrawal-fee settings from router helpers and emits only ERC4626 events (including solver flows triggered via router-exclusive hooks).
  - Holds no custom solver entrypoints; router is the single integration surface for advanced flows.

- `DStakeCollateralVaultV2` – non-upgradeable asset store (`contracts/vaults/dstake/DStakeCollateralVaultV2.sol`)
  - Holds ERC20 "strategy shares" (e.g., ERC4626 wrapper shares from upstream strategies) and exposes `totalValueInDStable()`.
  - Maintains a registry of supported strategy shares; adapters can be rotated without migrating balances.
  - Allows governance to delist strategy shares even if dust remains (avoids griefing vector).
  - Refuses to value a strategy share without a live adapter; NAV queries revert so governance must restore pricing or pause deposits before removal.
  - Grants `ROUTER_ROLE` to the active router so only the router can move collateral.

- `DStakeRouterV2` – deterministic orchestrator (`contracts/vaults/dstake/DStakeRouterV2.sol`)
  - Owns vault configuration, adapter registry, hook logic, and operational limits.
  - Receives deposit/withdraw callbacks from the token, performs single-strategy attempts, and transfers net assets directly to recipients.
  - Provides solver routes that accept vault/amount arrays for multi-vault servicing, typically from dSTAKE deposits/withdrawals.
  - Houses withdrawal fee calculation, incentive handling, reinvestment, settlement shortfall tracking, and emits detailed operational events.
  - Supports collateral exchanges, pausing, dust tolerance settings, surplus sweeping, and vault health checks under unified control flags.

- Adapters (`contracts/vaults/dstake/adapters/`)
  - Implement `IDStableConversionAdapterV2`. Each adapter knows how to convert dSTABLE ↔ specific strategy shares and report valuations in dSTABLE terms.
  - Must mint/burn strategy shares directly against the collateral vault. Examples: MetaMorpho, wrapped lending tokens.

- Rewards (optional) (`contracts/vaults/dstake/rewards/`)
  - Strategy-specific helpers that periodically claim and compound incentive tokens back into dSTABLE or strategy shares.

### Flow of Funds

- **User deposit / mint**
  1. dSTABLE moves into `DStakeTokenV2` via `deposit()`/`mint()`.
  2. `_deposit` mints shares, then the token approves the router and calls `router.handleDeposit(caller, assets, shares, receiver)`. The mint math uses `totalAssets()` so any recorded settlement shortfall is socialized across new entrants.
  3. Router enforces the global `depositCap` before moving funds from the token.
  4. Router pulls the freshly received dSTABLE from the token and attempts a single deterministic conversion into the most under-allocated active vault. `forceApprove` (with an explicit zero reset afterward) keeps non-standard ERC20s compatible.
  5. If the adapter reverts, the router bubbles up the error—no retries or silent fallbacks—preserving the fail-fast operating model.
  6. Successful conversions leave no router-held dust beyond the configured tolerance; share price reflects the new assets.

- **User withdraw / redeem**
  1. User requests a net dSTABLE amount; withdrawal previews already deduct the governance-configured fee.
  2. Token translates the request to gross assets, burns shares inside `_withdraw`, and triggers `router.handleWithdraw(caller, receiver, owner, grossAssets, expectedNet)`.
  3. Router walks the overweight strategies in deterministic order until it finds one that can satisfy the full request, exits it with strict slippage checks, and reverts if no vault has enough available liquidity or if the adapter fails.
  4. Router transfers the net amount directly to the receiver, reverting if the actual net falls below the token’s previewed `expectedNet`. Fee balances remain on the router so all shareholders benefit until reinvested.

- **Solver flows**
  - `solverDepositAssets` / `solverDepositShares` and their withdraw counterparts live on the router. They sum assets, enforce ERC4626 previews via the token helpers, and mint/burn shares through router-only hooks that emit ERC4626 `Deposit`/`Withdraw` events (`mintForRouter(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares)` and `burnFromRouter(msg.sender, receiver, owner, netAssets, shares)`).
  - Multi-vault deposits/withdrawals reuse the same dust tolerance and deterministic ordering; any failed adapter call reverts the entire solver transaction.
  - Router transfers net proceeds directly to recipients; token is not in the payout path.

- **Fee reinvestment**
  - Router-level `reinvestFees()` redeploys accumulated withdrawal fees after optionally paying the caller an incentive (capped at 20%). Funds are routed through the same single-strategy deposit path so share price keeps pace with collateral growth. The token exposes a helper that forwards the incentive from the router to the caller.

- **Collateral exchanges & rebalances**
  - Governance or operations can trigger `rebalanceStrategiesByShares`, `rebalanceStrategiesBySharesViaExternalLiquidity`, or `rebalanceStrategiesByValue` to move exposure between strategies. These functions work entirely in dSTABLE terms, consult adapter previews, enforce slippage via `dustTolerance`, and stage transfers through the collateral vault.
  - `sweepSurplus()` converts any dSTABLE left on the router (for example from rounding during withdrawals) back into the default deposit strategy shares.

### Router V2 Details

- **Deterministic allocation** – Uses `DeterministicVaultSelector` and `AllocationCalculator` libraries to compute current vs target allocations. Auto deposits target the most underweight strategy; auto withdrawals start with the most overweight strategy. Given identical inputs, the selector always produces the same vault, keeping routing behaviour repeatable across environments and tests.
- **Single-vault ERC4626 path** – Standard deposits still commit the full amount to the most underweight eligible vault. Withdrawals iterate the overweight set (most overweight first) until a vault with sufficient liquidity is found, reverting with `NoLiquidityAvailable` only after every candidate is exhausted. Adapter failures bubble up immediately. Operations that need multi-vault aggregation must call the solver entry points instead.
- **Allowance hygiene** – All approvals use OZ `forceApprove` and immediately zero allowances afterward so non-standard tokens stay compatible and no residual approvals linger.
- **Health checks & liveness** – Strategies must pass protocol health probes (`previewDeposit`, `previewRedeem`) to be considered active for an operation. Paused or unhealthy strategies are skipped automatically across auto-routing, solver withdrawals, rebalances, and surplus sweeps.
- **Adapter registry** – `_strategyShareToAdapter` pairs strategy shares with adapters. Adding an active strategy automatically registers the adapter and whitelists the strategy shares on the collateral vault. Removing a strategy also evacuates the adapter mapping.
- **Governance knobs** – `setVaultConfigs`, `add/update/removeVault`, `setDefaultDepositStrategyShare`, `setDustTolerance`, `setMaxVaultCount`, `setDepositCap`, `setWithdrawalFee`, `setReinvestIncentive`, surplus sweeping, pause controls, and settlement shortfall bookkeeping (`recordShortfall` / `clearShortfall`) all live on the router under dedicated roles.
- **Collateral exchanges** – Exchanges validate adapter previews in both directions and enforce `dustTolerance` when comparing expected vs realised dSTABLE value, preventing silent degradation across strategies.
- **Surplus handling** – Router retains withdrawal fees and any interim dSTABLE from solver operations. `reinvestFees()` and `sweepSurplus()` recycle these balances into the default strategy, first confirming the default vault is still eligible before forwarding funds; events document caller incentives and compounding cadence.

### DStakeTokenV2 Mechanics

- **totalAssets()** – Delegates to `router.totalManagedAssets()` and subtracts `router.currentShortfall()`. Any router-held dust within tolerance remains reflected so share price captures residual yields; the first depositor after a full unwind still inherits that dust like today.
- **Withdrawal fee plumbing** – Token implements the net/gross helpers inline and sources the active fee rate from the router, while the router performs the actual fee calculation and retention during `handleWithdraw`. Previews in the token continue to expose net values consistent with ERC4626 expectations.
- **ERC4626 conversions** – `convertToAssets` maps shares to gross assets without applying withdrawal fees, while `previewRedeem` continues to expose the net user-facing amount. Round-tripping through `convertToShares(convertToAssets(x))` therefore remains lossless even when a fee is configured.
- **ERC4626 hooks** – Token overrides `_deposit`/`_withdraw` to approve the router and delegate side effects once ERC4626 accounting is finished. OZ internals still handle ERC20 transfers and share mint/burn; router executes all downstream effects.
- **Solver access** – Token no longer exposes solver entry points. Router invokes restricted `mintForRouter`/`burnFromRouter` helpers when servicing solver flows.
- **Maintenance helpers** – Token includes `reinvestFees()` (passes router incentive to the caller) and `setSettlementShortfall()` (governance shim around router `recordShortfall`/`clearShortfall`).
- **Upgrade & governance** – Token stays upgradeable, but most new functionality now lands in the router. Token upgrades should be rare and focused on accounting changes.

### Collateral Vault Notes

- Enumerates supported strategy shares via an `EnumerableSet` and exposes helpers for enumerating them (`supportedStrategyShares`, `getSupportedStrategyShares`).
- Only the router (via `ROUTER_ROLE`) may move collateral or mutate the supported set; governance rotates routers with `setRouter`.
- Collateral movements happen through `transferStrategyShares(strategyShare, amount, recipient)`—the legacy `sendAsset` helper has been removed along with router retry scaffolding.
- Allows strategy share removal even if a balance remains, so governance can delist griefed strategy shares and recover funds manually if needed.
- Rescue functions exist for miscellaneous tokens/ETH sent by mistake, but disallow extracting dSTABLE or any supported strategy shares.

### Access Control Surface

- **Token roles** (`DStakeTokenV2.sol`)
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` – set router/collateral vault, upgrade implementations.
  - `FEE_MANAGER_ROLE` – adjust withdrawal fee and reinvest incentive.

- **Router roles** (`DStakeRouterV2.sol`)
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` – owns surpluses and global admin actions.
  - `DSTAKE_TOKEN_ROLE` – limited to the live `DStakeTokenV2` contract.
  - `STRATEGY_REBALANCER_ROLE` – execute share exchanges and strategy rebalances.
  - `ADAPTER_MANAGER_ROLE` – add/remove adapters.
  - `CONFIG_MANAGER_ROLE` – set defaults, risk limits, dust tolerance.
  - `VAULT_MANAGER_ROLE` – manage vault configs and lifecycle.
  - `PAUSER_ROLE` – pause/unpause router operations.

- **Collateral vault roles** (`DStakeCollateralVaultV2.sol`)
  - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` – rotate router, rescue tokens, configure governance.
  - `ROUTER_ROLE` – granted exclusively to the active router for asset movements.

### Safety Model & Invariants

- dSTABLE is the unit of account across previews, valuations, and routing decisions.
- Auto-routing enforces adapter reports: deposits revert if minted shares deviate, withdrawals revert if converted dSTABLE falls short of the request.
- `dustTolerance` (default 1 wei) permits small rounding mismatches during router-driven share exchanges and rebalances without blocking execution while still protecting against meaningful slippage. Standard auto-withdrawals still require the full requested amount.
- Router is `Pausable` and `ReentrancyGuard` protected. Deposit/withdraw paths halt when paused; solver routes are also gated by the same modifier chain.
- Collateral vault ignores unknown dust in TVL calculations so third parties cannot block accounting by donating unsupported tokens.
- Solver paths require the caller to supply dSTABLE or permit share burns; router enforces net settlement and fee deduction before any transfer to the recipient.

### Operational Playbooks

1. **Onboard a new strategy**
   - Implement `IDStableConversionAdapterV2` for the protocol and deploy it.
   - Call `addAdapter(strategyShare, adapter)` and grant `STRATEGY_REBALANCER_ROLE` if cross-strategy swaps are required.
   - Add a vault config (target BPS, activation flag). Ensure aggregate targets sum to 100%.
   - Optionally call `setDefaultDepositStrategyShare` to make the new strategy the default for surplus sweeps.

2. **Rotate routers**
   - Deploy the new router with references to the token and collateral vault.
   - Governance grants the router roles (`setRouter` on the collateral vault; `setRouter` on the token) and assigns appropriate admin/config roles.
   - The router now handles adapter cleanup internally, so it does not require `ADAPTER_MANAGER_ROLE` to remove its own adapters.
   - Optionally migrate vault configs by reusing `setVaultConfigs` on the new router.

3. **Manage fees**
   - Adjust withdrawal fee via `router.setWithdrawalFee()` (token proxy emits router events) within the 1% cap.
   - Tune caller incentive with `setReinvestIncentive()` (max 20%).
   - Schedule or automate `reinvestFees()` so fees re-enter strategies regularly.

4. **Rebalance exposure**
   - Use solver deposit/withdraw functions for one-off targeted moves without changing target allocations.
   - For structural changes, update vault configs or run `rebalanceStrategiesByShares`, `rebalanceStrategiesBySharesViaExternalLiquidity`, or `rebalanceStrategiesByValue` with conservative `min` values.

5. **Offboard a strategy**
   - Mark the vault impaired or suspended so auto-routing stops using it, then migrate positions via solver withdrawals or operator swaps.
   - Only call `removeAdapter` once the collateral vault no longer holds the strategy shares; otherwise NAV queries revert with `AdapterValuationUnavailable` and block user flows until a replacement adapter is installed.

### Mental Model (TL;DR)

- dSTAKE is an ERC4626 wrapper over dSTABLE that outsources allocation decisions to a deterministic router.
- The router maintains the active vault set, matches capital to target weights, and uses adapters for protocol-specific conversions.
- The collateral vault only stores strategy shares and reports their dSTABLE value; all movement is orchestrated by the router.
- Fees accrue inside the router (reflected in token pricing), are reinvested via router helpers, and the share price reflects upstream yield plus compounded fees.
- Governance tunes routes, fees, incentives, and safety limits while solver flows keep operations flexible.
